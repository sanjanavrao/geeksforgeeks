'''Given string s, the task is to find the count of all substrings which have the same character at the beginning and end.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcab"
Output: 7
Explanation: a, abca, b, bcab, 
c, a and b
Example 2:

Input: s = "aba"
Output: 4
Explanation: a, b, a and aba'''

USE THE FORMULA N*N+1/2

class Solution:
	def countSubstringWithEqualEnds(self, s):
		# code here
		fre = [0] * 26

        for char in s:
            fre[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    
        ans = 0
    
        for i in range(26):
            ans += (fre[i] * (fre[i] + 1)) // 2
    
        return ans
